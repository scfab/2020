The emergence of cryptocurrencies has created new
opportunities for loyalty programs. In this paper, we present
a proof-of-concept cryptocurrency loyalty program called
Unify Rewards where participants earned Ether
cryptocurrency by making purchases at participating
retailers. We outline the experiences gained from conducting
a field trial of the program with student and staff at UNSW
Sydney. The results from the trial which included 177
participants suggests that cryptocurrency is a viable
alternative to loyalty miles and points.
